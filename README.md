# study
A central repo for all of my code study.

- [/Exercism](https://github.com/hikurangi/study/tree/main/Exercism) contains my work on [Exercism](https://exercism.io/profiles/hikurangi), believe it or not.
- [/small-apps](https://github.com/hikurangi/study/tree/main/small-apps) contains independent toy projects.
- [/pluralsight](https://github.com/hikurangi/study/tree/main/pluralsight) well, you'll never guess what's in there.
